# openCV-to-face-detection
# Introduction 
This program uses OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries to detect faces in live video from a computer camera. OpenCV is a software library commonly used in the field of computer vision and image recognition, while Mediapipe is a development library from Google for visual and motion data processing.
and This program provides a simple way to detect faces in live video using OpenCV and Mediapipe. This code can be used as a starting point for building more complex applications based on face detection
